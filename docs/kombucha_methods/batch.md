# Batch Brewing

*Batch Brewing* is a method of brewing kombucha from start to finish.  Once the brewing has been completed, you return the [SCOBY](/glossary/#scoby) back to its hotel.

The basic method is as follows:

1. brew a sweet tea (see [recipes](../../recipes) for many alternatives)
2. add a [SCOBY](../../glossary/#scoby)
3. start sampling on day 5
4. When ready, keep some liquid as started tea, and remove scoby.
5. Bottle or jar your fresh new batch of kombucha
