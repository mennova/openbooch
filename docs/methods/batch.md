# Batch Brewing

Batch brewing is a method which completes a batch of kombucha from beginning to end in a single cycle.  The basic method is as follows:

1. brew a sweet tea (see [recipes](../../recipes) for many alternatives)
2. add a [SCOBY](../../glossary/#scoby)
3. start sampling on day 5
4. When ready, keep some liquid as started tea, and remove scoby.
5. Bottle or jar your fresh new batch of kombucha

If desired, these steps can be expanded to allow for a [second fermentation](../second_fermentation.md) ([2F](../../glossary/#2F)), building a [SCOBY hotel](../scoby_hotel), etc.
